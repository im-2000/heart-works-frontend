### Preview

First of all I am very grateful to Codaisseur and especially to each teacher individually. I learned a lot of stuff and consider final assesstment to be the right point to check myself. At the begining of this course I was confused, it was really difficult to understand something totally new and complex but I was moving forward and had to work hard day by no mater what and I am really glad that I am on this point right now and I feel satisfied.

### Workflow

When working on assesstment I was trying to focus on process and realized that when you too focused on final result - the process goes wrong and you are getting more chances to stuck and I did stucked for several hours and couldn't move on but then I switched to composing music and it was really helpful. Actually it took 2 days till friday late night to finish all the features and on Saturday morning I made final app testing, was cleaning my code and writing this reflection. It seems that I made all the features except one ("`userId` is not sent in the body or as a param of the request") but I hope to find out the solution from my teachers or classmates.

### Resume

In this part of reflection I would like to talk about my weak points in order to make them better and to move on faster with my portfolio.

- As I am totaly new in coding it difficult to think as experienced coder finding solution in your had thats why I've done all the assestments using previous codes from our teachers but while doing so you forget to think and find solutions by yourself. It is like count numbers ousing calculator and being lasy to count yourself. But this assessment prooved that working with templates and copy-pasting is wrong way, sometimes it helps, but sometimes it hurts. The better way to move on is writing code yourself step by step, importing and exporting needed elements etc;

- I have some difficulties when I need to write function and I undestand what should be inside the function but sometimes I don't understand where this funtion must live;

- I also have some troubles with understanding the whole process of organizing "Loading", "Doneloading' processes and Setting status codes to responses as well;

- It also seems that my biggest trouble is CSS, just because I had no time to learn it because I am trying to be more focused on coding process and going to learn styling after that, for eaxample while working on portfolio or while searching for job;
